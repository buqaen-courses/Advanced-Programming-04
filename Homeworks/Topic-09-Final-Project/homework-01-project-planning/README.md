# Homework 01: Final Project Planning & Design

## 📋 Overview

This homework focuses on planning and designing your final project that integrates concepts from all course topics. You will create a comprehensive project proposal and technical specification.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this homework, you will be able to:

- Integrate knowledge from all course topics
- Plan a full-stack Python application
- Design proper architecture and data models
- Create detailed technical specifications
- Prepare for implementation in Homework 2
