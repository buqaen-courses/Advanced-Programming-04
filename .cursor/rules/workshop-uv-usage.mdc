# UV Virtual Environment Usage in Workshops

## Overview
All workshop environments should use UV for virtual environment management instead of traditional `python -m venv`.

## Setup Instructions

When setting up workshop environments, always use UV:

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT: Use UV to create virtual environment
uv venv
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate

# ❌ INCORRECT: Don't use traditional venv
# python -m venv venv
# venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Benefits of UV
- **Faster**: 10-100x faster than pip
- **Integrated**: Handles projects, dependencies, and environments in one tool
- **Secure**: Verifies package integrity
- **Reproducible**: Lock files ensure consistent installations
- **Modern**: Designed for contemporary Python development

## Why This Matters
UV provides a superior development experience with better performance and reliability. All workshops should demonstrate modern Python development practices.
